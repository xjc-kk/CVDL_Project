# README

### Pix2Pix

Training example is shown in jupyter notebook file.

Data and code working folder example:

Pix2Pix_for_edges2shoes.ipynb

edges2shoes

​	train

​	val

It will build save_models and images_wg folders and sample images and models automatically.

If you want to use models, please order the files as:

Pix2Pix_for_edges2shoes.ipynb

edges2shoes

​	train

​	val

save_models

​	Generate_1

​	discriminator_80.pth

​	generator_80.pth

Remember to change epoch to 80 in ipynb file, notice that the suffix means the training epochs.

### CycleGAN_by_lsl

Train example is shown in jupyter notebook file.

The CycleGAN-Unet file uses Unet as generator backbone and the other uses ResNet as generator backbone.

Folder example:

CycleGAN-Unet.ipynb

CycleGAN.ipynb

Generate1

​	teA

​	teB

​	trainA

​	trainB

Notice that we cut and process the edges2shoes data into Generate1 folder.

It will build save_models/save_models_U and images/images_U folders and sample images and models automatically.

If you want to use models, please order the files as:

CycleGAN-Unet.ipynb

CycleGAN.ipynb

Generate1

​	teA

​	teB

​	trainA

​	trainB

save_models

​	Generate1

​		D_A_99.pth

​		G_AB_99.pth

​		D_B_99.pth

​		G_BA_99.pth

saved_models_U

​	Generate1

​		D_A_49.pth

​		G_AB_49.pth

​		D_B_49.pth

​		G_BA_49.pth

Don't forget to change the epoch in .ipynb to Corresponding epoch.

### CycleGAN_by_xjc

main.py:  This is the main file for training or testing the model.

network.py:  This file defines some useful layers used in the G and D models and the initialization function.

discriminators.py:  This file defines the Discriminator network.

generators.py:  This file defines the Generator network with 9 resnet blocks.

model.py:  This file defines the cycleGAN model and training steps.

utils.py:  This file defines some useful functions.

test.py:  This file is used to test the model output.

results:  The horse2zebra results generated by CycleGAN. (Real - Generated - Reconstructed)

![result](C:\Users\徐锦成\Desktop\result.jpg)

results2:  The apple2orange results generated by CycleGAN. (Real - Generated - Reconstructed)

![report_pic2](C:\Users\徐锦成\Desktop\report_pic2.jpg)

- To run training

```
python main.py --training True
```

- To run testing

```
python main.py --test True --batch_size 1
```

The default dataset is the horse2zebra dataset, if the TA wants to try apple2orange dataset, please add it as the argument.

We don't include the training data and the trained model in the submitted file since it takes too much space, we will upload it to the PKU disk and will share the link in the email. If the TA wants to test the result, the data and trained model should be named correctly and be put under the right folder. If there is any question about testing the result, please contact us.
