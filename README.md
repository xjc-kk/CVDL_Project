main.py:  This is the main file for training or testing the model.

network.py:  This file defines some useful layers used in the G and D models

and the initialization function.

discriminators.py:  This file defines the Discriminator network.

generators.py:  This file defines the Generator network with 9 resnet blocks.

model.py:  This file defines the cycleGAN model and training steps.

utils.py:  This file defines some useful functions.

test.py:  This file is used to test the model output.

latest.ckpt:  This documents the model parameters trained by us.

results:  The horse2zebra results generated by CycleGAN.(Real - Generated - Reconstructed)

- To run training

```
python main.py --training True
```

- To run testing

```
python main.py --test True --batch_size 1
```

We don't include the training data and the trained model in the submitted file since it takes too much space, we will upload it to the PKU disk and will share the link in the email. If the TA wants to test the result, the data and trained model should be named correctly and be put under the right folder. If there is any question about testing the result, please contact us.
